This repo serves as a data exploration of a _gas log_ recorded manually for my father's 1989 Ford F-150. He bought it new in May 1989, and luckily for me he kept a journal in the glove compartment in which he tracked a few different datums every time he filled up at the pump. When I obtained my driver's license in 2006 I, of course, continued the sacred tradition and updated the log as I went alone. Near the end of 2013 I input all the data into an Excel file and printed out some very basic graphical representations of the data as a Christmas gift. Now more than 4 years later I'm returning to this data set.  

I have no known goal with this data set except that I want to use it to practice some data exploration skills. I'm planning on using the Pandas library to explore the data, and hopefully learn somethings along the way. Additionally, this will be my first Github repo not done during some kind of guided course.
